  // ... other sizes
};
```

## Building for Production

### Development Build

```bash
# Debug build for testing
npx react-native run-ios --configuration Debug
```

### Release Build

```bash
# Production build
npx react-native run-ios --configuration Release
```

### App Store Build

```bash
# Build for App Store distribution
xcodebuild -workspace ios/CommunityApp.xcworkspace -scheme CommunityApp -configuration Release -destination generic/platform=iOS archive -archivePath build/CommunityApp.xcarchive

# Export IPA
xcodebuild -exportArchive -archivePath build/CommunityApp.xcarchive -exportPath build -exportOptionsPlist ios/exportOptions.plist

- Minimal re-renders with proper key usage
- Efficient comment thread handling

### Bundle Size

- Tree-shaking enabled for smaller bundles
- Optimized icon imports
- Lazy-loaded components where appropriate

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Metro bundler issues:**

```bash
npx react-native start --reset-cache
```

2. **iOS build failures:**

```bash
cd ios && pod install && cd ..
```

3. **Image picker not working:**

- Ensure camera/photo library permissions in Info.plist
- Check iOS simulator limitations

4. **Share functionality not working:**

- Test on physical device (simulator may have limitations)
- Verify app is properly signed

### Debugging

Enable debugging in development:

```bash
# Enable React Native debugger
npx react-native start --verbose

# iOS device debugging
npx react-native log-ios
```
